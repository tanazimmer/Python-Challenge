# Python-Challenge
## Week 3 of Data Analytics and Visualization
### Primary Coding Language: Python

#### Pypoll
In this challenge, I was provided with a set of poll data comprising of 3521001 lines composed of columns 'Voter ID', 'County', and 'Candidate'.  The task was to create a python script to analyze the dataset and calculate each of the following:

    - The total number of votes cast
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total numbr of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote

The results were then exported to a text file.


#### PyBank
In this challenge, I was provided with financial records of a company comprising of 86 lines composed of columns 'Date' and 'Profits/Losses'.  The task was to create a python script to analyze the dataset and calculate each of the following:

    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The greatest increase in profits (data and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in losses (data and amount) over the entire period

The results were then exported to a text file.
